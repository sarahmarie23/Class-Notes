## üîë Key Points üîë

    1. Arrays and their functions
    2. Vectors and their functions
    3. 2D arrays and vectors

## üåü Array vs vector? - Make a table to compare them

‚úÖ Arrays and Vectors are both data structures.

‚úÖ They both hold elements of the same type.

‚úÖ They both are accessible by index.

‚úÖ Vectors are **dynamic**. They can grow and shrink.

‚úÖ You don't need to declare the size when you initialize Vectors.

‚úÖ Vectors have their own set of methods.

‚úÖ Add your own facts!

## üì¶ Arrays: Declare, insert element, access element, looping, functions

> ‚ú® A string can be represented as an array of chars, which is why you could access chars like `my_string[i]`.



### 1D arrays

_**Ways to initialize**_

1. No elements - **Must declare a size!**

    ```cpp
    string schedule[4] = {};  
    ```

2. With all elements

    ```cpp
    string schedule[] = {"CSS 132", "Calc 1", "American history"}; 
    ```

3. With some elements

    ```cpp
    string schedule[4] = {"CSS 132"}; 
    ```

> ‚ú® If you don't add a size, it will take the size of the number of elements!

_**Insert element**_

* Access it at an index `schedule[2] = "Physics";`

> ‚ú® If there is already an element there, it will be overridden.

> ü§î‚ùì What happens if I did `schedule[5] = "Physics";`?

_**Access element**_

> `string my_class = schedule[2];`

### Looping through an array

* For loop - How do you get the size?

> ‚úîÔ∏è To get the size: ```sizeof(array_name);``` but this is the size in **bytes**. To get the quantity, divide by the size of the first element.

```cpp
cout << "size of schedule: " << sizeof(schedule) << endl; // returns 96
int num_classes = sizeof(schedule) / sizeof(schedule[0]); // returns 3 

for (int i = 0; i < num_classes; i++) {
  printf("Class %i: %s\n", i, schedule[i].c_str());
}
```

> ‚ú® To `printf()` a string, add `.c_str()` to the end of the string variable.

* For each loop

```cpp
for (string c : schedule) {
  cout << c << endl;
}
```
> ‚ú® Fun fact: You wouldn't be able to use `string class` (which is more clear!) because `class` is a reserved word in C++.

_**Array functions**_

### `sort()`

`sort(arr, arr + arr_size);`

> ‚ú®Don't forget to import the `<algorithm>` library!

> ‚úîÔ∏è **Note on sorting strings:** They will be sorted by ASCII value. Capital letters are "less" than lowercase.

### `swap()` - Simply indicate which to swap

`swap(arr[0], arr[1]);`

> ü§î‚ùì Can you swap an entire array? How about in a 2D array, swap one element from one array into another array? Can you swap elements in two separate arrays?

### 2D arrays

* Must assign the size of the inner arrays!
* Leaving the first [] empty is optional. It will figure out the size (3 in this case).

```cpp
string year[][3] = {
  {"CSS 132", "Calc 1", "American history"},
  {"CSS 133", "Calc 2", "Writing"},
  {"Chemistry", "Econ", "Music"}
};
```

* Getting the size works the same as getting the size for a 1D array

```cpp
int num_semesters = sizeof(year) / sizeof(year[0]);
```

> ‚ú® We want to know how many elements are in the array. This 2D array has arrays for its elements, so how many inner arrays are there?

* Looping goes **Row by Row** on the outer loop and **Column by Column** on the inner looop!

```cpp
for (int sem = 0; sem < num_semesters; sem++) {
  for (int c = 0; c < num_classes; c++) {
    cout << year[sem][c] << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;
}
```

> ‚ú® You can use i for the outer loop and j for the inner loop, but it can be helpful to use variables that represent your use case.

## ‚ÜóÔ∏è Vectors

* Like an array, but it is resizable

_**Ways to initialize**_

1. No elements

```cpp
vector<string> v_classes;
```

2. With elements

```cpp
vector<string> v_classes = {"CSS 132", "Calc 1", "American history"};
```

_**Insert element**_

1. Insert at the end

```cpp
v_classes.push_back("Art");
```

2. Insert somewhere else

```cpp
v_classes[0] = "Art"; // Just like an array
v_classes.at(0) = "Art";
```

_**Access element**_

```cpp
string first_class = v_classes[0]; // Just like an array
string next_class = v_classes.at(1);
```

### Looping through a vector

* Using a for each loop: Same as for an array

```c++
for (string s : v_classes) {
  cout << s << " " << endl;
}
```

* Using a for loop: You can use the size() function to easily get the size

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < v_classes.size(); i++) {
  printf("Class %i: %s\n", i, v_classes[i].c_str());
}
```

### 2D Vector looping

> ‚ú® Note the `vector<vector<string>>` data type
* The rest is the same as the array

* For loop

```cpp
vector<vector<string>> v_year = {
  {"CSS 132", "Calc 1", "American history"},
  {"CSS 133", "Calc 2", "Writing"},
  {"Chemistry", "Econ", "Music"}
};

for (int sem = 0; sem < v_year.size(); sem++) {
  for (int c = 0; c < v_year[0].size(); c++) {
    cout << v_year[sem][c] << " ";
  }
  cout << endl;
}
```
* And we were able to use the `size()` function

* For each loop

```cpp
for (vector<string> sem : v_year) {
  for (string s : sem) {
    cout << s << " " << endl;
  }
  
  cout << endl;
}
```
> ‚ú® There is an easier way: use `auto` instead of `vector<string>` and `string` in the for each loop expressions.

### Vector functions

* `at()` - Get the element at that index
* `front()` - Get the first element
* `back()` - Get the last element
* `push_back()` - Add element to the end
* `pop_back()` - Remove element from the end
* `size()` - Get the size of the vector
* `empty()` - Returns true if a vector is empty, false otherwise
* `vector1.swap(vector2)` - Swap the contents of two vectors
